This R code cleans personal information starting from the Excel file provided by the CRM, which contains all information about queries we receive.

In order to use it:
1. Export and download from the CRM the list of all queries: please note that the file might be in .xls extension. If that is the case, convert it with Excel into xlsx
2. Rename the file to 'data.xlsx' and put it inside the folder of this repository (only locally)
3. Open the Rproj: it should open RStudio. Here open final.R
4. Run the code
5. it will output data_cleaned.xlsx
